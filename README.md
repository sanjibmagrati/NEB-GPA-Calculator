# NEB-GPA-Calculator
  🎓 NEB Class 12 GPA Calculator (The Simple Online Tool)

Hello! This website tool is made to help all Nepali students easily calculate their final NEB Class 12 results.

The National Examination Board (NEB) uses a specific grading system (like the one used from 2025/2026). Doing the calculation can be confusing and slow. This simple online tool removes all the guesswork! Just put in your marks or grades, and it instantly gives you your accurate Grade Point Average (GPA).

It is designed to be your quick, reliable helper for checking results and preparing reports.

 3. Flexible Input: You choose the easiest way to enter your scores:
 4. Enter Marks: Type in your numerical marks (e.g., 78/100). The tool converts them to the right Grade Point.
 5. Select Grades: Simply select the grade you got (A+, B+, C).
